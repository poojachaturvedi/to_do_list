CUSTOM HOOKS
--there are lot of inbuilt hooks like useEffect,useMemo etc which are predefined
--we can make our own react hooks which can be reused again and again in react
--hooks are like the regullar js functions

identifying  HOOKS
--uses the "use" keyword as a prefix
--regular js functions
--problem is making any UI useable but making a logic reuseable is not hectic
--we can make some peice of logic reuseable
--mmain idea is to maintain the concept of dry


react follows the DRY concept 
where dry means --Don't repeat Yourself
eg:increment button and like button has similar logic but different 
--dry means not copying but to write the logic ones and then create a function and then call it 


list:
push:to add value to the list
pull(index):to pull value from the list
